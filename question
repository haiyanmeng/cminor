are we allow to use %left and %right to define associativity?
can we just do return without any expression: return (return_stmt)
can we do: for(;;) (for_stmt)
can we do a statement without anything but a semicolon: ; (expr_stmnt)
is this legal: x: array[] char = {'a', 'b'};
is this legal: puts: function void ( string );
