if (..)
	int x = 6;
does this open a new scope?

can we put a function prototype after the function definition?

if a function name is redefined? are we supposed to resolve the fuction body? 


x:integer = 3;
z:integer = x1+3;
resolve error: the intializer of a global variable (z) should not involve another global variable (x1)!
in this case, x1 is also not defined yet. how many different errors should this contribute?
