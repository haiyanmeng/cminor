Todo:
enrich the error msg
add memory allocation successful check. check function return value
valgrind check memory leak
3-D array typechecking

array index must be meaning ful; if array size is n; the index must be 0 ~ n-1. no.
use an variable before intializing it. no.
does a single integer literal overflow checking? no.

is the following legal?
    a:array[2]array[3] integer = {{1, 1,1}, {1,2,23}};
    b:array[2]array[3] integer = a;
this is legal.

<<<< Done:
add lineno to the error output.
remove additional output

print function and void
param and local seq: only declaration and function prototype can increase the local sequence;
comma expression requirement, if it is used to initialize array, then they must have the same time; if they use to do funcation call, there is no requirement they need to have the same time.
function call return value;
type of function return values;
stmt typecheck;
decl typecheck;
resolve check;
locally, function prototype conflicting.
check to catch all the type errors
decl_resolve: preserve all the function protoypes; so that the type checker can validate the function protype and function definition
double check the notes to see what error are type check error, and what error are name resolution.

resolve function prototype; test whether prototype can be after func definition;

test if body only a single expr_stmt without {}; what happened if we define a new variable there?
track the error number; print all the errors;


function call numbers == function prototype numbers;
function nesting? no, you can not do function nested.
test what happen if you do function nested?
function prototype can be in function, yes. even in the function definition of itself.


what happened if there is no expr in if stmt?
	if() parser will complain


add id to param and local and global symbol which field
the rvalue of global variable can not have variable.
function body resolve

#done
if else and for end { tune
change + - sign for integer;
change char and string to output literally
carefully control the space around tokens
