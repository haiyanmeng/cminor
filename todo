Todo:
function call return value;
function call numbers == function prototype numbers;
type of function return values;
comma expression requirement.

line number 
test different kinds of function
x:array[5] integer = {5, x+3, x=8};

decl_resolve: preserve all the function protoypes; so that the type checker can validate the function protype and function definition

double check the notes to see what error are type check error, and what error are name resolution.

resolve function prototype; test whether prototype can be after func definition;

test if body only a single expr_stmt without {}; what happened if we define a new variable there?

track the error number; print all the errors;

check header file includes
add lineno to the error output.
add memory allocation successful check. check function return value
valgrind check memory leak
remove additional output

<<<< Done:

function nesting? no, you can not do function nested.
test what happen if you do function nested?
function prototype can be in function, yes. even in the function definition of itself.


what happened if there is no expr in if stmt?
	if() parser will complain


add id to param and local and global symbol which field
the rvalue of global variable can not have variable.
function body resolve

#done
if else and for end { tune
change + - sign for integer;
change char and string to output literally
carefully control the space around tokens
